> [!WARNING] 
> The original app and its code have been deleted. I use this app since a lot of time, so I decided to continue the development by adding features that I find useful, updating the codebase...
> Releases will be signed with my own signature, so a backup is needed to switch from the original app, but the app can be installed alongside the original.<br>
